# Placental Blood Flow Animation

This project is an interactive educational tool that demonstrates the sequential stages of placental blood flow between maternal and fetal circulations. The animation visualizes the complex exchange of blood, nutrients, and gases that occurs in the placenta during pregnancy.

## Features

- Step-by-step visualization of placental blood flow
- 9 distinct stages showing different aspects of the circulation
- Interactive controls for playback, speed adjustment, and stage navigation
- Detailed explanations for each stage
- Visual representation of oxygen and nutrient exchange

## How to Use

1. **Play/Pause**: Start or pause the animation
2. **Previous/Next**: Navigate to the previous or next stage
3. **Reset**: Return to the initial state
4. **Speed**: Adjust the animation speed with the slider
5. **Auto-advance**: When enabled, automatically proceeds to the next stage after completion
6. **Labels**: Toggle visibility of anatomical labels
7. **Jump to Stage**: Click on any stage in the list to jump directly to it

## Development

This project was built with React and TypeScript.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+)
- npm (v6+)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/wangyunai/placental-flow-animation.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd placental-flow-animation

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start
```

## Educational Value

This animation is designed for medical students, healthcare professionals, and anyone interested in understanding the fascinating process of placental circulation. The visualization helps to clarify:

- The unique structure of the placenta
- How maternal and fetal blood circulations interact without mixing
- The process of nutrient and gas exchange
- The path of blood flow on both maternal and fetal sides
